Abstract

CCS Concepts

Generative recommender systems have gained increasing attention as an innovative approach that directly generates item identifiers for recommendation tasks. Despite their potential, a major challenge is the effective construction of item identifiers that
align well with recommender systems. Current approaches often treat item tokenization and generative recommendation training as separate processes, which can lead to suboptimal performance. To overcome this issue, we introduce ETEGRec, a novel
End-To-End Generative Recommender that unifies item tokenization and generative recommendation into a cohesive framework.
Built on a dual encoder-decoder architecture, ETEGRec consists
of an item tokenizer and a generative recommender. To enable
synergistic interaction between these components, we propose
a recommendation-oriented alignment strategy, which includes
two key optimization objectives: sequence-item alignment and
preference-semantic alignment. These objectives tightly couple
the learning processes of the item tokenizer and the generative
recommender, fostering mutual enhancement. Additionally, we develop an alternating optimization technique to ensure stable and
efficient end-to-end training of the entire framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our approach
compared to traditional sequential recommendation models and existing generative recommendation baselines. Our code is available

Introduction

In recommender systems, it is essential to model the sequential
patterns of user behaviors, so as to effectively predict the future
interactions for target users. Such task setting is typically formulated as sequential recommendation [7, 10, 20, 26], which has attracted increasing research attention. Traditional sequential recommenders [7, 10, 22] are often developed based on sequence models
(e.g., RNN, CNN, and Transformer) and make the predictions in a
discriminative way, i.e., evaluating the similarity between the observed past sequence and candidate items, then selecting the most
similar item(s) for recommendation.
Recently, drawing from the promising potential of generative
language models [23, 35], several studies have emerged to apply
the generative paradigm in recommender systems [19, 24, 30, 32].
Different from discriminative methods, the generative approach
formulates the sequential recommendation task as a sequence-tosequence problem and autoregressively generates the identifiers of
target items. Specifically, it generally involves two main aspects,
namely item tokenization and autoregressive generation, for developing the entire recommendation framework. For item tokenization,
it basically refers to assigning a list of meaningful IDs for indexing
or representing an item. Existing efforts include parameter-free
methods based on the co-occurrence matrix [9, 16], text feature

SIGIR ’25, July 13–18, 2025, Padua, Italy

identifier [2, 12, 24], hierarchical clustering [21, 32], and multi-level
vector quantization (VQ) [13, 17, 19, 30]. Furthermore, several recent
studies attempt to improve the quality of item identifiers by introducing collaborative signals [30], diversified regularization [30],
or multi-behavior information [14, 32]. For autoregressive generation, the encoder-decoder architecture (e.g., T5 [18]) is the most
widely used backbone due to its excellent capabilities in sequence
modeling and generation. In addition, there are also some studies that aim to improve performance by adjusting the backbone
architecture [21, 32] or the learning objectives [21].
Despite these advancements, existing approaches typically consider item tokenization as a pre-processing step for subsequent generative recommendation. This results in a complete decoupling of
the item tokenization and autoregressive generation during model
optimization, which likely hinders the potential of generative recommendation due to two major reasons. Firstly, the item tokenizer
is essentially unaware of the optimization objectives for recommendation or simply not the best match for the recommender. Secondly,
the generative recommender cannot deeply fuse or further refine
the prior knowledge implicitly encoded in item representations
from the item tokenizer. In light of these concerns, we aim to develop an end-to-end generative recommendation framework that
seamlessly integrates item tokenization and autoregressive generation. To realize this seamless integration of tokenization and
generation, we highlight two primary challenges: (1) How to integrate the item tokenizer and generative recommender into a unified
recommendation framework; (2) How to achieve mutual enhancement between the item tokenizer and generative recommender for
end-to-end optimization.
To this end, in this paper, we propose ETEGRec, an End-To-End
Generative Recommender that seamlessly integrates item tokenization and autoregressive generation. Our framework adopts a dual
encoder-decoder architecture, where the item tokenizer adopts
Residual Quantization Variational Autoencoder (RQ-VAE), and the
generative recommender is a Transformer model similar to T5. The
key novelty of our approach lies in that the item tokenizer can be
jointly optimized with the generative recommender, which significantly differs from prior studies that use heuristic or pre-learned
item tokenizers. In order to achieve mutual enhancement between
these two components, we design two recommendation-oriented
alignment strategies, which include sequence-item alignment and
preference-semantic alignment. Specifically, sequence-item alignment requires that the quantized token distributions from the encoder’s sequential states and the collaborative embedding of the
target item should be similar, and preference-semantic alignment
employs contrastive learning to align the user preference captured
by the Transformer decoder with the target item semantics reconstructed by RQ-VAE. Generally, our objective is to seamlessly integrate the tokenizer with the recommender through a well-crafted
alignment approach, thereby fostering the mutual enhancement
between the two components. Finally, to ensure stable and effective
end-to-end learning, we further devise an alternating optimization
method for joint training.
In summary, our main contributions are as follows:
• We propose a novel end-to-end generative recommender that
achieves mutual enhancement and joint optimization of item tokenization and autoregressive generation.

Enze Liu, et al.

• We design a recommendation-oriented alignment approach
that mutually enhances the item tokenizer and the generative
recommender through sequence-item alignment and preferencesemantic alignment.
• We conduct extensive experiments on three recommendation
benchmarks, demonstrating the superiority of our proposed framework compared with both traditional sequential recommendation
models and generative recommendation baselines.

Related Work

In this paper, we review the related work in two major aspects.
Sequential Recommendation. Sequential recommendation aims
to predict the next item a user may interact with based on the
user’s historical behavior sequences. Early studies [20] primarily
adhere to the Markov Chain assumption and focus on estimating
the transition matrix. With the development of neural networks,
various model architectures, such as Recurrent Neural Networks
(RNN) [7, 25], Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) [26] and
Graph Neural Networks (GNN) [1, 33], are applied for sequential
recommendation. Recently, Transformer [29]-based recommendation models [5, 10, 22, 42] have achieved great success for effective
sequential user modeling. SASRec [10] utilizes Transformer decoder with unidirectional self-attention to capture user preference.
BERT4Rec [22] proposes to encode the sequence by bidirectional attention and adopts the mask prediction task for training. S3 Rec [42]
explores using the intrinsic data correlation as supervised signals
to pre-train the sequential model for better user and item representations. Furthermore, several works [34, 38] exploit the abundant
textual features of users and items to enrich the user and item representations. In this work, we focus on exploring the generative
paradigm for sequential recommendation.
Generative Recommendation. Nowadays, generative recommendation has emerged as a next-generation paradigm for recommendation systems. In such a generative paradigm, the item sequence
is tokenized into a token sequence and then fed into generative
models to predict the tokens of the target item autoregressively.
Generally, the generative paradigm can be considered as two main
processes, i.e., item tokenization and generative recommendation.
Existing approaches for item tokenization can be broadly categorized into parameter-free methods [9, 16, 21, 24, 32, 36], and
deep learning methods based on multi-level vector quantization
(VQ) [17, 19, 30, 31]. For parameter-free methods, some studies,
e.g., CID [9] and GPTRec [16], apply matrix factorization to the
co-occurrence matrix to derive item identifiers. Other works like
SEATER [21] and EAGER [32] employ clustering of item embeddings to construct identifiers hierarchically. In addition, there are
also some attempts [2, 6, 12, 24, 36] to use the textual metadata
attached to items, e.g., titles and descriptions, as identifiers. While
these non-parametric methods are highly efficient, they often suffer
from length bias and fail to capture deeper collaborative relationships among items. Deep learning methods based on multi-level VQ
instead develop more expressive item identifiers with equal length
via the Deep Neural Networks (DNN). For instance, TIGER [19] uses
RQ-VAE to learn the codebooks. LETTER [30] proposes to align

Generative Recommender with End-to-End Learnable Item Tokenization

quantized embeddings in RQ-VAE with collaborative embeddings
to leverage both collaborative and semantic information.
Reviewing the existing works on generative recommendation,
we found that most of them treat item tokenization and generative
recommendation as two independent stages which may not be
optimal for generative recommendation. In contrast, in this work,
we achieved integration between item tokenization and generative
recommendation via a recommendation-oriented alignment for
superior recommendation performance.

Methodology

In this section, we elaborate on ETEGRec, which develops a joint
optimization framework for item tokenization and generative recommendation. In Section 3.1, we formally define the generative
recommendation task. Then we present the dual encoder-decoder
architecture of our framework in Section 3.2, comprising an item tokenizer and a generative recommender. In Section 3.3, we introduce
the recommendation-oriented alignment including two alignment
objectives, i.e., sequence-item alignment and preference-semantic
alignment, to align the two components from two different perspectives. Finally, we describe in detail the alternating optimization
approach in Section 3.4. An illustration of our proposed framework
is shown in Fig. 1.

3.1

Problem Formulation

As the task setting, following prior studies [10, 22], we consider a
typical sequential recommendation scenario. Given the item set I
and an interaction sequence 𝑆 = [𝑖 1, 𝑖 2, . . . , 𝑖𝑡 ] from a target user 𝑢,
sequential recommendation aims to predict the next item 𝑖𝑡 +1 ∈ I
that user 𝑢 is likely to interact with. To approach this task, we take
the generative paradigm by casting sequential recommendation as
token sequence generation [19]: each item is indexed or represented
by a specific ID identifier, and the task aims to generate the ID
identifier of the future interacted item. As a straightforward approach, we can represent each item with its original item ID (e.g., a
unique product number or a randomly assigned number). However,
such an approach cannot effectively share similar semantics among
different items, while often leads to a large item vocabulary.
In a more generic way, each item 𝑖 is represented by multiple
tokens [𝑐 1, . . . , 𝑐 𝐿 ], where 𝐿 denotes the identifier length. In practice, 𝐿 can vary for different items, while we follow RQ-VAE [37]
to use the same identifier length for all the items, to reduce the
potential length bias in item prediction [21, 30]. Following the convention in natural language processing [18], we refer to the process
of mapping an item into multiple tokens as item tokenization. In
this representation scheme, the input interaction sequence 𝑆 can be
first tokenized into the token sequence 𝑋 = [𝑐 11, 𝑐 21, . . . , 𝑐 𝑡𝐿−1, 𝑐 𝑡𝐿 ],
where each item in 𝑆 is represented by its identifier (i.e., 𝐿 tokens)
and 𝑡 is the original item index in the interaction sequence 𝑆. To
obtain the item identifiers, previous studies either adopt the heuristic method [3, 9, 12] or employ a pre-learned tokenizer [19, 30] for
item tokenization. In this work, we consider devising an end-to-end
approach for learning both the item tokenizer and the recommender
backbone. The objective of generative recommendation is to first
derive the token sequence 𝑋 and then generate the corresponding
identifier of the target item 𝑌 = [𝑐 𝑡1+1, . . . , 𝑐 𝑡𝐿+1 ] at the (𝑡 + 1)-th

step. Formally, this task can be formulated into a typical sequenceto-sequence learning problem as follows:
𝑃 (𝑌 |𝑋 ) =

𝐿
Ö

𝑃 (𝑐𝑙𝑡 +1 |𝑋, 𝑐 𝑡1+1, .., 𝑐𝑙𝑡 +1 ).

𝑙=1

3.2

Dual Encoder-Decoder Architecture

Our proposed framework consists of two main components, namely
the item tokenizer T and generative recommender R, both taking
the encoder-decoder architecture. The input item-level interaction
sequence is first mapped into the token sequence by the item tokenizer before being fed into the recommender. Then the generative
recommender models the token sequence and autoregressively generates the item tokens for recommendation.
3.2.1 Item Tokenizer. As introduced in Section 3.1, we adopt a 𝐿level hierarchical representation scheme for item tokenization, in
which each item is indexed by 𝐿 token IDs. By taking a hierarchical
scheme, we essentially organize the items in a tree-structured way,
which is particularly suitable for generative tasks. Another merit
is that the collaborative semantics among items can be shared by
the same prefix tokens. Based on the above general idea, we next
introduce the details for instanting the item tokenizer.
Token Generation as Residual Quantization. We implement the
item tokenizer as a RQ-VAE, which constructs multi-level tokens
via residual quantization. For each item 𝑖, the item tokenizer T
takes as input its contextual or collaborative semantic embedding
𝒛 ∈ R𝑑𝑠 1 , where 𝑑𝑠 is the dimension of the semantic embedding.
The output is its quantized tokens at each level, denoted as:
[𝑐 1, . . . , 𝑐 𝐿 ] = T (𝒛),

(2)

where 𝑐𝑙 denotes the corresponding token of 𝑖 at the 𝑙-th level.
Specifically, we first encode 𝒛 into a latent representation via a
multilayer perceptron network (MLP) based encoder:
𝒓 = Encoder𝑇 (𝒛).

(3)

Then, the latent representation 𝒓 is quantized into serialized codes
(called tokens) by looking up 𝐿-level codebooks, where 𝐿 is the
token length of each item. At each level 𝑙 ∈ {1, . . . , 𝐿}, we have a
𝐾 , 𝒆𝑙 ∈ R𝑑𝑐 , where 𝐾 is the codebook size.
codebook C𝑙 = {𝒆𝑘𝑙 }𝑘=1
𝑘
Subsequently, the residual quantization can be conducted as:
𝑐𝑙 = arg max 𝑃 (𝑘 |𝒗𝑙 ),

(4)

𝑘

𝒗𝑙 = 𝒗𝑙 −1 − 𝒆𝑐𝑙 𝑙 −1 .

(5)

where 𝑐𝑙 is the 𝑙-th assigned token, 𝒗𝑙 is the residual vector at the
𝑖-th level, and we set 𝒗 1 = 𝒓. In the above equation, 𝑃 (𝑐𝑙 = 𝑘 |𝒗𝑙 )
represents the likelihood that the residual is quantized to token
𝑘, which is measured by the distance between 𝒗𝑙 and different
codebook vectors. This probability can be formulated as:
exp(−||𝒗𝑙 − 𝒆𝑘𝑙 || 2 )
𝑃 (𝑘 |𝒗𝑙 ) = Í𝐾
.
𝑙 2
𝑗=1 exp(−||𝒗𝑙 − 𝒆 𝑗 || )

(6)

1 To obtain the semantic embeddings 𝒛 , we can run conventional recommendation

algorithms (e.g., SASRec) over the interaction data.

Residual Quantization (RQ)

Figure 1: The overall framework of ETEGRec. ETEGRec consists of two main components, the item tokenizer and the generative
recommender. Sequence-Item Alignment (SIA) and Preference-Semantic Alignment (PSA) achieve their alignment from two
different perspectives for mutual enhancement.
Reconstruction Loss. Through the above process, RQ-VAE quantifies the initial semantic embedding into different levels of tokens
from a coarse-to-fine granularity [19, 37]. After that, we can obtain the item tokens [𝑐 1, . . . , 𝑐 𝐿 ] and the quantized representation
Í𝐿 𝑙
𝒓˜ = 𝑙=1
𝒆𝑐𝑙 ∈ R𝑑𝑐 . Subsequently, 𝒓˜ is fed into a MLP based decoder
to reconstruct the item semantic embedding:
𝒛˜ = Decoder𝑇 ( 𝒓˜ ).

(7)

The semantic quantization loss for learning the item tokenizer is
formulated as follows:
LSQ = LRECON + LRQ,
2

˜ ,
LRECON = ||𝒛 − 𝒛||
LRQ =

𝐿
∑︁

|| sg[𝒗𝑙 ] − 𝒆𝑐𝑙 𝑙 || 2 + 𝛽 ||𝒗𝑙 − sg[𝒆𝑐𝑙 𝑙 ]|| 2,

and 𝑌 = [𝑐 𝑡1+1, . . . , 𝑐 𝑡𝐿+1 ] by T . Then the corresponding token embeddings 𝑬 𝑋 ∈ R |𝑋 | ×𝑑ℎ are fed into the generative recommender
for user preference modeling, where 𝑑ℎ is the hidden size of the
recommender. Formally, we begin with token sequence encoding:
𝑯 𝐸 = Encoder𝑅 (𝑬 𝑋 ),

decoding, we add a special start token “[BOS]” at the beginning of
𝑌 to construct the decoder input 𝑌˜ = [[BOS], 𝑐 𝑡1+1, . . . , 𝑐 𝑡𝐿+1 ]. Then,
𝑯 𝐸 along with 𝑌˜ are fed into the decoder to extract user preference
representation:

(8)
(9)
(10)

𝑙=1

where sg[·] denotes the stop-gradient operation [27], and 𝛽 is the
coefficient that balances the optimization between the encoder and
codebooks, typically set to 0.25. LRECON is the reconstruction loss
to guarantee that the reconstructed semantic embedding closely
matches the original embedding, while LRQ is the RQ loss that
works to minimize the distance between codebook vectors and
residual vectors.
3.2.2 Generative Recommender. For the generative recommender,
we utilize a Transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture similar to T5 [18] for sequential behavior modeling, as it has shown
effectiveness in generative recommendation studies [3, 9, 19].
Token-level Seq2Seq Formulation. During training, the itemlevel user interaction sequence 𝑆 and the target item 𝑖𝑡 +1 are first
tokenized into the token-level sequence 𝑋 = [𝑐 11, 𝑐 21, . . . , 𝑐 𝑡𝐿−1, 𝑐 𝑡𝐿 ]

(11)

where 𝑯 𝐸 ∈ R |𝑋 | ×𝑑ℎ is the encoded sequence representation. For

𝑯 𝐷 = Decoder𝑅 (𝑯 𝐸 , 𝑌˜ ),

(12)

where 𝑯 𝐷 ∈ R (𝐿+1) ×𝑑ℎ is decoder hidden states that imply user
preferences over the items.
Recommendation Loss. By performing inner product with the
vocabulary embedding matrix 𝑬, 𝑯 𝐷 is further employed to predict
the target item token at each step. Specifically, we optimize the
negative log-likelihood of target tokens based on the sequence-tosequence paradigm:
LREC = −

𝐿
∑︁

log 𝑃 (𝑌 𝑗 |𝑋, 𝑌< 𝑗 ),

(13)

𝑗=1

where 𝑌 𝑗 represents the 𝑗-th token of target tokens, and 𝑌< 𝑗 denotes
the tokens before 𝑌 𝑗 . In this way, the tokens of a target item will
be generated autoregressively.

3.3

Recommendation-oriented Alignment

In previous work [16, 19, 21, 30], the item tokenizer and the generative recommender are treated as two separate components: the
tokenizer is often trained in the preprocessing stage to generate

Generative Recommender with End-to-End Learnable Item Tokenization

SIGIR ’25, July 13–18, 2025, Padua, Italy

tokens for each item but is subsequently fixed during recommender
training. Such an approach neglects the effect of item tokenization
on the generative recommendation, which cannot adaptively learn
more suitable tokenizers for the corresponding recommender. To
address this limitation, an ideal approach is to jointly learn both
the item tokenizer and the generative recommender for mutual
enhancement between the two components. For this purpose, we
devise two new training strategies for aligning the two components,
namely sequence-item alignment and preference-semantic alignment.
3.3.1 Sequence-Item Alignment. We first introduce the training
strategy for sequence-item alignment.
Alignment Hypothesis. To align the two components, we consider the item tokenizer as an optimizable component when training
the recommender. We employ it to obtain the corresponding token distributions for the target item based on different inputs (See
Eq. (6)), and generate supervision signals based on the idea that
two associated inputs should produce similar token distributions
via the tokenizer. In this way, we can utilize the derived supervision
signals to optimize the involved two components. In our approach,
we adopt an encoder-decoder architecture, and assume that the
hidden states 𝑯 𝐸 (Eq. (11)) from the encoder should be highly related to the collaborative embedding 𝒛. The former 𝑯 𝐸 encodes the
entire information of the past interaction sequence, while the latter
𝒛 captures the characteristics of the target item. When we feed
both kinds of representations into the tokenizer, they should yield
similar tokenization results. Thus, we refer to such an association
relation as sequence-item alignment.
Alignment Loss. Based on the above alignment hypothesis, we
next formulate the corresponding loss for joint optimization. Specially, we first linearize the hidden state 𝑯 𝐸 by applying a mean
pooling operation:
𝒛 𝐸 = MLP(mean_pool(𝑯 𝐸 )),

(14)

where an additional MLP layer is further applied for semantic space
transformation. Subsequently, we employ the item tokenizer to
generate the token distribution for each level (Eq. (6)), and let 𝑃𝒛𝑙
and 𝑃 𝑙 𝐸 denote the token distributions at the 𝑙-th level for inputs of
𝒛

𝒛 (collaborative item embedding) and 𝒛 𝐸 (encoder’s sequence state),
respectively. Our objective is to enforce the two distributions to be
similar, since the past sequence state should be highly informative
for predicting the future interaction. Formally, we introduce the
symmetric Kullback-Leibler divergence loss is as follows:
LSIA = −

𝐿 
∑︁



𝐷𝐾𝐿 𝑃𝒛𝑙 ||𝑃𝒛𝑙 𝐸 ) + 𝐷𝐾𝐿 𝑃𝒛𝑙 𝐸 ||𝑃𝒛𝑙 ) ,

(15)

𝑙=1

where 𝐷𝐾𝐿 (·) is the Kullback-Leibler divergence between two probablity distributions.
In addition to component fusion, another merit of this alignment
loss is that it can enhance the representative capacity of the encoder. It has been found that the decoder might bypass the encoder
(i.e., seldom using the information from the encoder) to fulfill the
generation task [11], so that the encoder could not be well trained
in this case. Our alignment loss can alleviate this issue and improve
the overall sequence representations.

3.3.2 Preference-Semantic Alignment. Next, we introduce the second alignment loss.
Alignment Hypothesis. Specifically, we aim to leverage the connection between the decoder’s first hidden state 𝒉𝐷 (the first column
in 𝑯 𝐷 from Eq. (12)) and the reconstructed semantic embedding 𝒛˜
(Eq. (7)). The former 𝒉𝐷 is learned by modeling the interaction sequence and reflects the sequential user preference, while the latter
𝒛˜ encodes the collaborative semantics of the target item. Therefore, we refer to such an association relation as preference-semantic
alignment. Note that different from the recommendation loss, we
˜ so that it naturally involves the
use the reconstructed embedding 𝒛,
tokenizer component in the optimization process.
Alignment Loss. Next we employ InfoNCE [4] with in-batch
˜ the
negatives to align 𝒉𝐷 (also with MLP transformation) and 𝒛,
preference-semantic alignment loss is defined as follows:
!
˜
˜ 𝒉𝐷 )/𝜏)
exp (s( 𝒛,
exp (s(𝒉𝐷 , 𝒛)/𝜏)
LPSA = − log Í
+ log Í
,
𝐷
ˆ
˜ 𝒉)/𝜏)
exp (s( 𝒛,
𝒛ˆ ∈ B exp (s(𝒉 , 𝒛ˆ )/𝜏)
ˆ
𝒉∈ B

(16)

where 𝑠 (·, ·) is the cosine similarity function, 𝜏 is a temperature
coefficient and B denotes a batch of training instances. This loss
can also be considered as an additional enhancement of the recommendation loss (Eq. (13)), which uses the tokens of target items.
By incorporating the reconstructed collaborative embedding, this
loss involves the tokenizer component during training, which can
enhance mutual optimization.
Through the above two alignment strategies, we can effectively
enhance the association between the two components during model
optimization and thus can facilitate mutual enhancement by making
necessary adaptations to each other.

3.4

Alternating Optimization

Based on the dual encoder-decoder architecture and recommendationoriented alignment, a straightforward approach is to jointly optimize the objectives of the item tokenizer and generative recommender as well as the alignment losses. In order to improve the
training stability, we propose an alternating optimization strategy to
mutually train the item tokenizer and the generative recommender.
Item Tokenizer Optimization. The item tokenizer is optimized
by jointly considering the semantic quantization loss LSQ (Equation (8)), sequence-item alignment loss LSIA (Equation (15)) and
preference-semantic alignment loss LPSA (Equation (16)), while
keeping all parameters of the generative recommender fixed. The
overall loss can be denoted as follows:
LIT = LSQ + 𝜇LSIA + 𝜆LPSA,

(17)

where 𝜇 and 𝜆 are hyperparameters for the trade-off of the alignment losses.
Generative Recommender Optimization. As for the generative
recommender, we optimize it through the generative recommendation loss LREC (Eq. (13)), the above two alignment losses LSIA
(Eq. (15)) and LPSA (Eq. (16)), while freezing all parameters of the
item tokenizer. The optimization objective is:
LGR = LREC + 𝜇LSIA + 𝜆LPSA .

(18)

SIGIR ’25, July 13–18, 2025, Padua, Italy

In general, we divide the training process into multiple cycles,
each consisting of a fixed number of epochs. In the first epoch of
each cycle, we optimize the item tokenizer based on Eq. (17) to
improve the quality of item representations by the generative recommender. As for the rest epochs of each cycle, the item tokenizer
is frozen and item tokens remain fixed during the generative recommender training process. This alternation continues until the item
tokenizer converges, after which we permanently freeze it and fully
train the generative recommender to convergence This approach
ensures stable optimization when conducting the recommendationoriented alignment.

Discussion and Analysis

3.5.1 Comparison with Existing methods. Recently, there have been
notable advancements in generative recommendation models. To
highlight the innovations and distinctions of our proposed approach, we conduct a comparative analysis between ETEGRec and
several typical generative recommendation models from two perspectives: item tokenization and generative recommendation, as
presented in Table 1.
Item tokenization in current generative recommendation models can be broadly classified into two categories: heuristic methods
and pre-learned methods [19, 30]. Heuristic methods, such as GPTRec [16] and CID [9], employ manually constructed user-item
interaction matrix or item co-occurrence matrix to estimate similarity between items. Although these methods are straightforward and
efficient, they often fail to capture the profound semantic relevance
between items. As for pre-learned methods like TIGER and LETTER, they pre-learn a deep neural network as the item tokenizer
(e.g., autoencoder) to derive identifiers with implicit semantics.
However, these methods treat item tokenization as a preprocessing step, resulting in a complete decoupling of item tokenizer and
generative recommender during model optimization. In contrast,
ETEGRec integrates the tokenizer and recommender into an end-toend framework to address this decoupling problem and achieves
mutual enhancement between the two components by proposing a
recommendation-oriented alignment approach. Furthermore, from
the interaction-aware perspective, only GPTRec introduces interaction awareness through the user-item interaction matrix. Different
from them, ETEGRec aligns the past user interaction sequence and
the target item from two different perspectives, thereby incorporating the preference information within user behaviors into the item
tokenizer.
Generative recommendation in existing methods typically
processes user interaction sequences into corresponding token sequences in advance. Such constant data suffer from monotonous
sequence patterns, which brings the risk of overfitting. In contrast, ETEGRec jointly optimizes the item tokenizer during model
learning, resulting in diverse token sequences and gradually refined
semantics. The ablation experiment in Section 4.3 confirmed that
the continuous enhancement of token sequences significantly contributes to the performance. Moreover, unlike existing methods that
isolate the item tokenizer in generative recommendation, our approach further integrates and refines the prior knowledge implicit
in item semantic embeddings from the item tokenizer.

3.5.2 Complexity Analysis. For item tokenization, considering a
single item as an example, the time complexity of the encoder
and decoder layers is O (𝑑 2 ), where 𝑑 is the model dimension. The
time complexity for codebook lookup operations is O (𝐿𝐾𝑑), where
𝐾 is the size per codebook and 𝐿 is the codebook number. The
computation complexity of the semantic quantization loss is O (𝑑 +
𝐿𝑑). Thus, the total time complexity for tokenizing one item is
O (𝑑 2 + 𝐿𝐾𝑑). For generative recommendation, the time complexity
of sequential preference modeling primarily stems from the selfattention and feed-forward layers, which is O (𝑁 2𝑑 +𝑁𝑑 2 ) where 𝑁
represents the sequence length. The time used by calculating losses
of REC, SIA and PSA is O (𝐿𝐾𝑑), O (𝐿𝐾𝑑) and O (𝑀𝑑), respectively,
where 𝑀 is the number of negative samples. Overall, the training
cost is O (𝑁 𝐿𝐾𝑑 + 𝑁 2𝑑 + 𝑁𝑑 2 + 𝑀𝑑), which is on the same order
of magnitude as mainstream models (e.g., TIGER and LETTER).
The inference complexity of our proposed method is completely
consistent with TIGER, as the item tokenization results can be
cached in advance.

Experiments

In this section, we begin with the detailed experiment setup and
then present overall performance and in-depth analysis of our proposed approach.

4.1

Experiment Setup

4.1.1 Dataset. We conduct experiments on three subsets of the
most recent Amazon 2023 review data [8] to evaluate our approach,
including “Musical Instruments”, “Video Games”, and “Industrial Scientific”. All these datasets comprise user review data from May 1996
to September 2023. Following previous works [41, 42], we apply
the 5-core filter to exclude unpopular users and items with less
than five interaction records. Then, we construct user behavior sequences according to the chronological order and uniformly set the
maximum item sequence length to 50. The statistics of preprocessed
datasets are shown in Table 2.

Model

4.1.2 Baseline Models. The baseline models we adopt for comparison include the following two categories: (1) Traditional sequential
recommendation models: Caser [26] utilizes horizontal and vertical
convolutional filters to model user behavior sequences. HGN [15]
employs hierarchical gating networks to capture both long-term
and short-term user interests from item sequences. GRU4Rec [7]
is an RNN-based sequential recommender that uses GRU for user
behavior modeling. BERT4Rec [22] introduces bidirectional Transformer and mask prediction tasks into sequential recommendation
for user preference modeling. SASRec [10] adopts the unidirectional Transformer to model user behaviors and predict the next
item. FMLP-Rec [43] proposes an all-MLP sequential recommender
with learnable filters, which can effectively reduce user behavior
noise. FDSA [38] emphasizes the transformation patterns between
item features by separately modeling both item-level and featurelevel sequences using self-attention networks. S3 -Rec [42] incorporates mutual information maximization into sequential recommendation for model pre-training, learning the correlation between
items and attributes to improve recommendation performance. (2)
Generative recommendation models: SID [9] sequentially encodes
item IDs according to user interaction order and utilizes them as
item identifiers for generative recommendation. CID [9] integrates
collaborative knowledge into LLM-based generative recommender
by generating item identifiers through spectral clustering on item
co-occurrence graphs. TIGER [19] leverages text embedding to
construct semantic IDs for items and adopts the generative retrieval
paradigm for sequential recommendation. TIGER-SAS [19] uses
the item embeddings from trained SASRec instead of text embeddings to construct semantic IDs, which enables item identifiers to
imply collaborative prior knowledge. LETTER [30] designs a learnable tokenizer by integrating hierarchical semantics, collaborative
signals, and code assignment diversity.
4.1.3 Evaluation Settings. To evaluate the performance of various
methods in sequential recommendation, we employ two widely

used metrics: top-𝐾 Recall and top-𝐾 Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG), where 𝐾 is set to 5, and 10. Following prior
studies [19, 42], we employ the leave-one-out strategy to split training, validation, and test sets. Specifically, for each user, the latest
interaction is used as testing data, the second most recent interaction is validation data, and all other interaction records are used
for training. We conduct the full ranking evaluation over the entire
item set to avoid bias introduced by sampling. The beam size is
uniformly set to 20 for all generative recommendation models.
4.1.4 Semantic ID Generation. We obtain 256-dimensional item
collaborative semantic embeddings from a trained SASRec [10]. For
the item tokenizer, we utilize a 3-layer MLP for both the encoder
and decoder in the RQVAE. The number of codebooks 𝐿 is set to
3, with each codebook containing 𝐾 = 256 code embeddings of
dimension 128. To ensure the uniqueness of semantic item IDs,
following the approach in TIGER [19] we append an additional
token at the end of the semantic tokens.
4.1.5 Implementation Details. For our generative recommender,
we employ T5 with 6 encoder and decoder layers as the backbone.
The hidden size and the dimension of the feed-forward network
(FFN) are set to 128 and 512, respectively. Each layer consists of
4 self-attention heads with a dimension of 64. We utilize a pretrained RQ-VAE to initialize our item tokenizer and employ the
AdamW optimizer with a weight decay of 0.05 to train the entire
framework. The number of epochs per cycle 𝐶 is tuned in {2, 4}. The
training process begins with training the item tokenizer for 1 epoch,
followed by training the generative recommender for 𝐶-1 epochs.
This process is repeated until convergence based on validation
performance. The learning rates for the generative recommender
and item tokenizer are tuned within the ranges of {5e-3, 3e-3, 1e-3}
and {5e-4, 1e-4, 5e-5}, respectively. The hyper-parameters 𝜇 and 𝜆
are tuned within the range {5e-3, 1e-3, 5e-4, 3e-4, 1e-4}.
Traditional recommendation baselines are implemented by an
open-source recommendation framework RecBole [39, 40]. For CID,

Overall Performance

We evaluate ETEGRec on three public recommendation benchmarks. The overall results are presented in Table 3, from which we
have the following observations:
• Among traditional sequential recommendation models, FDSA
exhibits superior performance compared with others across three
datasets, which is attributed to the utilization of additional textual
feature embeddings. FMLP-Rec achieves comparable performance
as SASRec and BERT4Rec which suggests that all-MLP architectures
can also model the behavior sequence effectively.
• For generative recommendation models, TIGER and TIGERSAS consistently outperform CID and SID across all three datasets,
even though CID and SID adopt the pretrained T5 model with
more parameters. This performance disparity can be attributed to
their distinct item tokenization methods. Specifically, SID leverages
numerical tokens to index items, which lack semantic information.
CID employs a heuristic tokenizer based on the item co-occurrence
graph to construct item identifiers; however, this approach fails
to effectively capture the similarity between items. In contrast,
TIGER and TIGER-SAS learn hierarchical textual or collaborative
semantics from coarse to fine granularity through RQ-VAE, which
is more beneficial for recommendation tasks. Notably, TIGER-SAS
demonstrates comparable performance to TIGER on all datasets,
indicating that both collaborative and textual semantics contribute
significantly to recommendation performance. LETTER performs
best across most cases, as it effectively incorporates collaborative
and textual semantic information.
• ETEGRec consistently achieves the best results on all datasets
compared to the baseline methods, which demonstrates its effectiveness. We attribute the improvements to the mutual enhancement between the item tokenizer and the generative recommender
through the recommendation-oriented alignment.

• w/o LPSA removes the preference-semantic alignment (PSA)
(Eq. (16)), which also brings a performance degradation. The phenomenon demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed PSA loss,
which can enhance user preference modeling.
• w/o LSIA & LPSA without both LSIA and LPSA . The variant
lacking both alignments performs worse than removing just one.
These results show that both sequence-item alignment and preferencesemantic alignment positively contribute to generative recommendation, with their combination leading to improved performance.
• w/o AT directly jointly learns all involved optimization objectives in our framework. We can find that omitting the alternating
training strategy from ETEGRec leads to a significant performance
decline. This result suggests that frequent updates to the item tokenizer during training adversely affect the recommender’s training.
By employing alternating training, we achieve stable and effective training for both components while maintaining collaborative
alignment within them.
• w/o ETE bypasses the end-to-end optimization process and
instead leverages the final item tokens obtained by our ETEGRec to
retrain a generative recommender. From the results, it can be seen
that the improvement of ETEGRec is not only due to superior item
identifiers but also attributed to the integration of prior knowledge
encoded in the item tokenizer with the generative recommender.

Ablation Study

In order to evaluate the impact of the proposed techniques in ETEGRec, we conduct an ablation study on all three datasets. The
performance of the four variants is depicted in Table 4.

4.4.3 Hyper-Parameter Analysis. For sequence-item alignment, we
investigate it by varying the coefficient 𝜇 from 1e-4 to 5e-3. As
illustrated in Fig. 4, increasing 𝜇 beyond this optimal range could
interfere with model learning and adversely affect performance.
The optimal results are achieved with 𝜇 = 3e-4 for the Instrument
and Scientific dataset, and 𝜇 = 1e-3 for the Game dataset. To explore
the influence of preference-semantic alignment, we tune 𝜆 within
the range from 0 to 5e-3 and observe similar trends to those seen
with 𝜇, as shown in Fig. 4. ETEGRec yields suboptimal performance
at too large 𝜆 and performs best on all three datasets when 𝜆 = 1e-4.

4.4.2 Preference-Semantic Representation Visualization. To further
validate the effectiveness of our proposed preference-semantic alignment (i.e., Equation (16)), we employ t-SNE [28] to visualize the
preference representation h𝐷 and semantic representations of the
˜ as shown in Figure 3. Specifically,
corresponding target items 𝑧,
we select 10 items and 80 corresponding interaction histories from
Instrument and Scientific datasets and extract the preference and
reconstructed semantic representations. From Figure 3, we observe
that the preference points are closely clustered around their corresponding target semantic points while being separated from other
semantic points, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed
PSA in aligning sequential user preference and the target item
semantics.

Specifically, we select 5% of users with the least interaction history
as new users on Instrument and Scientific datasets, and then evaluate the recommendation performance for both seen and unseen
users. From Fig. 2, it is evident that ETEGRec outperforms LETTER
and TIGER on both seen and unseen users. This indicates that ETEGRec processes a more robust ability to model users’ preferences
through the alignment between item tokenizer and generative recommender.

end-to-end generative recommendation framework. We further
designed a recommendation-oriented alignment approach, comprising sequence-item alignment and preference-semantic alignment,
to achieve mutual enhancement of the two components from two
different perspectives. To enable effective end-to-end learning, we
further proposed an alternating optimization strategy for joint
component learning. Extensive experiments and in-depth analysis
on three benchmarks have demonstrated the superiority of our
proposed framework, ETEGRec, compared to both traditional sequential recommendation models and generative recommendation
baselines. In future work, we will transfer the joint tokenization
method to other generative recommendation architectures, and also
explore the scaling effect when increasing the model parameters.
