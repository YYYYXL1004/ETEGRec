Abstract
Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate significant advantages in leveraging structured world knowledge and multistep reasoning capabilities. However, fundamental challenges
arise when transforming LLMs into real-world recommender
systems due to semantic and behavioral misalignment. To
bridge this gap, we propose Align3 GR, a novel framework that unifies token-level, behavior modeling-level, and
preference-level alignment. Our approach introduces: Dual
tokenization fusing user-item semantic and collaborative signals. Enhanced behavior modeling with bidirectional semantic alignment. Progressive DPO strategy combining self-play
(SP-DPO) and real-world feedback (RF-DPO) for dynamic
preference adaptation. Experiments show Align3 GR outperforms the SOTA baseline by +17.8% in Recall@10 and
+20.2% in NDCG@10 on the public dataset, with significant
gains in online A/B tests and full-scale deployment on an industrial large-scale recommendation platform.

Introduction
Recommender systems (RS) are essential infrastructures
in modern digital platforms such as e-commerce (Li and
Karahanna 2015), video streaming (Lubos, Felfernig, and
Tautschnig 2023), and social media (Narayanan 2023). With
the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs),
researchers have explored two primary paradigms for integrating LLMs into recommender systems. Initially, LLMs
have been employed to enhance traditional discriminative
recommenders, for example, by providing improved content and user understanding (Wu et al. 2023), or enabling
query rewriting and reasoning (Ye et al. 2023). More recently, LLMs have been developed as standalone generative recommenders, where the model directly outputs recommended items in an end-to-end manner (Rajput et al. 2023;
Zheng et al. 2024). This shift from augmentation to full replacement brings forth a fundamental challenge: How can
LLMs be truly transformed into recommender systems?
The key is effectively aligning the fundamental gap between the pre-trained LLMs and the personalized recommendation system (Wang et al. 2025b): On the one hand,

language modeling is primarily concerned with the semantic information with next-token prediction (NTP); on the
other hand, recommender systems tend to model users’ implicit preferences based on their interaction behavior information (Chen et al. 2024a). Recent research efforts (Li
et al. 2025; Wang et al. 2024b) have attempted to bridge
this gap. We systematically summarized them into a unified alignment pipeline spanning three indispensable levels:
tokenization, multi-task supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and
preference-based reinforcement learning (RL).
First, tokenization serves as the foundation by transforming user and item information into compact and expressive
token representations (Jia et al. 2025), and EAGER (Wang
et al. 2024b) and DAS (Ye et al. 2025) have incorporated
collaborative signals at this stage to better bridge the gap between language modeling and downstream NTP tasks that
require user-item interaction modeling. Second, the objective of the SFT stage is to enable general-purpose LLMs to
comprehend the data structures and user behavior patterns
inherent to recommendation tasks, thereby equipping the
model with initial recommendation capabilities (Hong et al.
2025). Third, preference-based RL is essential for aligning
model outputs with real user interests and business objectives, thereby enhancing the personalization of recommendations (Deng et al. 2025).

Figure 2: (a) The architecture of Align3 GR, a unified multi-level alignment framework for generative recommendation, which
integrates hierarchical dual SCID, multi-task SFT, and progressive DPO. (b) Token-level alignment is achieved through useritem dual SC encoders and RQ-VAEs. (c) Preference-level alignment is accomplished via progressive SP-DPO and RF-DPO.
Despite their merits, previous methods often treat user
and item information independently during tokenization, neglecting the collaborative and semantic dependencies between them. Such isolated modeling fails to capture the mutual influences critical for comprehensive preference learning and has been shown to result in suboptimal recommendation performance (Zhang et al. 2025). On the other hand,
aligning LLMs with real-world user preferences and business objectives presents additional challenges (Wang et al.
2025a; Tan et al. 2025). Although recent preference-based
RL methods like DPO (Srivastava et al. 2025; Furuta et al.
2024) attempt to incorporate user preference signals into the
RS, they typically rely on the collection of offline data without any progressive learning mechanisms. In real-world recommendation scenarios, user behavioral preferences are inherently complex and ambiguous compared to explicit labels, increasing the difficulty for models to learn directly.
To address these challenges, we propose Align3 GR, a
unified multi-level alignment framework that systematically integrates token-level, behavior modeling-level, and
preference-level alignment. Specifically, our approach first
introduces a hierarchical tokenization scheme, enabling
compact and jointly optimized Semantic-Collaborative ID
(SCID) for both users and items, which lays a solid foundation for subsequent SFT and preference-based RL, ensuring
effective alignment throughout the entire recommendation
pipeline. Next, during behavior modeling-level alignment,
we further introduce two additional tasks. We first incorpo-

rate the user’s SCID into the main sequence generation task,
enriching the input representation and enabling the model to
leverage more comprehensive user features. Then, we introduce a bidirectional alignment task between the user’s SCID
and their semantic information, which explicitly grounds the
SCID tokens in their real-world semantic meanings. Furthermore, inspired by curriculum learning (Liao et al. 2024),
we introduce a progressive DPO strategy (easy to hard)
that enables the model to improve continually by learning from preference pairs of increasing difficulty, leading
to smoother convergence and more stable training. Building on this, we adopt the self-play DPO (SP-DPO), which
involves interacting with itself to generate diverse training data, thereby performing cost-efficient adversarial bias
correction on SFT models (Gao et al. 2025) and alleviating the exploration bottleneck of traditional RL. However,
the lack of real-world feedback during self-play limits the
model’s ability to generalize to real-world scenarios. Hence,
we incorporate real-world feedback DPO (RF-DPO), progressively aligning the model with actual user interests and
business objectives. Specifically, the RF-DPO also follows
a progressive strategy. Finally, we conduct comprehensive
experiments on both public and industrial datasets to validate the effectiveness of our approach. On the Instruments
dataset, Align3 GR outperforms the SOTA baseline by 17.8%
in Recall@10 and 20.2% in NDCG@10, demonstrating consistent and substantial improvements over strong generative
baselines. Moreover, the gains are further corroborated by

real-world business metrics in industrial settings. The core
contributions of this work are as follows:
1) We propose Align3 GR, a unified alignment framework
that jointly optimizes token-level, behavior modeling-level,
and preference-level alignment to bridge the gap between
LLMs and RS.
2) We design a dual tokenization scheme that enables semantic and collaborative fusion at the input level. In addition, we develop a progressive DPO strategy, including SPDPO and RF-DPO, adapted for dynamic scenario preference
alignment in RS.
3) Comprehensive experiments on benchmark and industrial datasets demonstrate consistent performance gains
across all settings, with Align3 GR yielding significant improvements in offline metrics and online A/B testing spanning diverse recommendation scenarios.

Related Works
Generative Recommendation
Generative recommendation (Wang et al. 2023) reframes
classical retrieval as a sequence generation task, enabling
models to benefit from complete semantic context and dynamically adaptable output formats. Generative approaches
are different from standard embedding-based design (e.g.,
two-tower models with ANN search (Briskorn and Dienstknecht 2019)) in that they autoregressively generate
item tokens (e.g., IDs, titles, semantic IDs), enabling dynamic, context-aware recommendations. The three key technical directions are as follows: First, sequence generation
retrieval (e.g., DSI (Tay et al. 2022; Chen et al. 2023)
and GENRE (Si et al. 2023)) transforms retrieval into autoregressive user context token generation. Second, breakthroughs in indexing or tokenization, such as RQ-VAE (Lee
et al. 2022), hierarchical k-means (Qi et al. 2017), and
PQ (Jegou, Douze, and Schmid 2010), transform content
embeddings into short discrete tokens, powering generative
recommendation models like TIGER (Rajput et al. 2023),
LC-Rec (Zheng et al. 2024), LETTER (Wang et al. 2024a),
and EAGER-LLM (Hong et al. 2025).

Preference Alignment of LLMs
Alignment of LLMs with human preferences has been extensively studied in NLP, primarily through Reinforcement
Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) (Bai et al. 2022)
and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) (Rafailov et al.
2023). While RLHF guides policy updates via reward models built from human annotations, it suffers from instability and high computational costs. DPO addresses these limitations by directly optimizing model parameters on preference data, inspiring variants such as IPO (Yang, Tan, and Li
2025), cDPO (Furuta et al. 2024), rDPO (Qian et al. 2025),
and Softmax-DPO (Chen et al. 2024b) to tackle noise robustness and unbiased learning. However, applying these techniques to recommender systems remains challenging due to
sparse, implicit preference data, which limits static offline
optimization and adaptation to dynamic user interests and
business objectives (Deng et al. 2025). Recent advances,

including curriculum learning (Liao et al. 2024) and selfplay (Wu et al. 2024; Gao et al. 2025), have improved preference alignment. Notably, progressive strategies enhance
robustness by organizing training from easy to hard preference pairs. Our work builds on these progressive strategies
to bridge static preference optimization and the dynamic demands of large-scale recommender systems.

Methodology
Overview of the Proposed Framework
In this work, we propose Align3 GR—a unified multilevel alignment framework that systematically bridges the
gap between LLMs and recommender systems. As illustrated in Figure 2, our framework consists of three tightly
aligned stages: First, at the token level, we introduce
a novel tokenization scheme based on a user-item dual
learning strategy, enabling dual-track fusion of user/itemspecific semantic-collaborative features to generate hierarchical discrete SCID, while maintaining a compact token
space and minimizing computational overhead during both
training and inference. Second, at the behavior modeling
level, we design an enhanced multi-task SFT based on LCRec (Zheng et al. 2024) by not only incorporating the SCID
of users but also explicitly aligning these SCIDs with their
semantic information through the user alignment task during explicit index-language alignment. Finally, at the preference alignment level, we draw inspiration from curriculum learning to propose a progressive DPO strategy (easy
to hard), combining self-play DPO (SP-DPO) for continual self-improvement with real-world feedback DPO (RFDPO), while simultaneously addressing preference learning from both generative performance and real user feedback perspectives. Together, these three levels form a coherent alignment pipeline that enables our LLM-based GR
model to achieve both high-quality personalization and robust adaptation in large-scale dynamic recommendation.

Token-level Alignment: Dual SCID Tokenization
Current tokenization methods for generative recommendation primarily encode items while overlooking user structure modeling. Although some incorporate user representations, these are seldom co-optimized with item embeddings, resulting in suboptimal user-item alignment and representations that lack critical collaborative signals for recommendation. We argue that a truly effective tokenization
scheme should jointly encode both users and items, leveraging their respective semantic and collaborative signals, and
must leverage a unified, co-optimized framework to learn
mutually aligned, expressive representations.
Dual SCID Tokenization addresses these gaps by integrating semantic and collaborative features for users and
items within a unified dual learning framework (Figure 2b).
Specifically, we first extract both semantic features (e.g.,
profiles or descriptions) and collaborative features (e.g., behavioral patterns) for users and items. These features are
processed by dedicated encoders: a frozen semantic encoder
(initialized with LMs like T5 (Ni et al. 2021)) captures textual representations, while a frozen collaborative encoder
(e.g., DIN (Zhou et al. 2018)) models behavioral dynamics.

The resulting semantic and collaborative embeddings are
then concatenated and passed through a hybrid SemanticCollaborative (SC) Encoder (e.g., MLP), which integrates
both information types to produce unified SC embeddings
(SCu, SCi). Finally, we quantize these unified embeddings
into SCID using RQ-VAE (Lee et al. 2022). The training
objective consists of two main components. First, at the embedding level, we optimize a sampled-softmax user-item behavior loss to enhance alignment between user and item SC
embeddings. LU2I , defined as follows:

#

(1)

where B is the batch size, and u and v represent SCu
and SCi, the positive examples are user-item interaction behaviors. Nu is the set of negative samples, which are randomly sampled within the batch. Second, the overall joint
loss combines the U2I behavior loss and quantization losses
from user-specific and item-specific RQ-VAE as:
L = α · LU2I + γ · (LUser RQ + LItem RQ )

(2)

where LUser RQ and LItem RQ denote the reconstruction and
quantization losses for user and item embeddings, and α, γ
are trade-off hyperparameters. In practice, we first set α =
1, γ = 0 and optimize LU2I to stabilize behavior alignment
and ensure thorough learning of the SC Encoder (monitored
via AUC). Once stabilized, we switch to α = 0.1, γ = 1
to focus on optimizing the quantization losses. During inference, user and item modules are deployed separately, each
generating their own SCID for downstream use.
This design not only compresses the token space but
also enables more effective downstream multi-task SFT and
preference-based RL by preserving collaborative relationships throughout the model pipeline.

Behavior Modeling-level Alignment: Multi-task
SFT
After obtaining quantized SCIDs for each user and item
through alignment tokenization, we continue to enhance the

generative and semantic alignment capabilities of the LLM
in the new token space. Following previous work (Zheng
et al. 2024), we first expand the LLM vocabulary to include
the SCID tokens of the user and the item, thus avoiding outof-vocabulary issues and ensuring smooth integration with
autoregressive generation tasks.
We formulate a multi-task SFT framework based on LCRec, which includes multiple tasks: Sequential Item Prediction, Asymmetric Item Prediction, Item Prediction Based
on User Intention, and Personalized Preference Inference.
These tasks aim to enhance the model’s ability to capture sequential dependencies, understand implicit user preferences,
and align user behavior with items diversely and adaptively.
However, LC-Rec remains limited in capturing user–item
collaborative and semantic relationships. To address this, we
propose two key enhancements: First, we inject the user’s
SCID token into all task prompts, as shown in Figure 3, to
ensure richer contextual alignment. Second, we introduce
bi-directional alignment objectives (B.2): one task predicts
a user’s SCID token from their profile text (text → SCID),
while the other reconstructs the user profile text from a given
SCID token (SCID → text).
Compared with prior works, our SFT design enriches user
modeling by directly incorporating SCID tokens and explicitly aligns structured and semantic information through bidirectional tasks, providing a stronger foundation for downstream preference optimization.

Preference-level Alignment: Progressive DPO with
Self-Play and Real-world Feedback
Although previous stages enable the model to have preliminary recommendation capability, simple preference optimization after SFT is insufficient for continual improvement
or robust business alignment, due to the limited coverage
of annotated preference data, which fails to capture the full
complexity of real recommendation scenarios. To address
this, we introduce progressive DPO with self-play (SP-DPO)
and real-world feedback (RF-DPO). Specifically, SP-DPO
first leverages self-play to acquire basic generative abilities,
by generating diverse and informative data, thereby mitigating data sparsity and exploration limitations. Then RF-DPO
utilizes real-world feedback to constrain the model toward
real recommendation tasks, forming a synergistic, progressive learning strategy. The progressive DPO is based on the
Softmax-DPO (Chen et al. 2024b) by constructing training
samples containing multiple rejected responses, which is initialize as SFT model. The training objective for each stage
is formally defined as:
"

where πθi denotes the current policy at stage i, πref
is the
i
reference policy, x is the prompt, yw is the chosen response,

Yli is the set of rejected responses, Di is the progressive
training set at stage i and β is a hyperparameter, and σ(·)
is the sigmoid function. The fine-tuned model at each stage
i+1
becomes the reference model for the next stage (πθi → πref
),
enabling the model to progressively adapt to more nuanced
preference distinctions.
Progressive SP-DPO leverages self-play mechanisms to
enhance the model’s generative capability by comparing its
generated outputs with the ground truth. Specifically, considering the hierarchical nature of SCID, we divide progressive SP-DPO learning into three stages: Easy, Medium, and
Hard, using a prefix-ngram match metric (Zheng et al. 2025)
(the same prefix exhibits similar semantic and collaborative
information). For the easy stage, the chosen and rejected
SCID responses of preference data are completely different,
with no shared prefix-ngram, making them easy to distinguish. For the medium and hard stages, the prefix-ngram
overlap between chosen and rejected SCID responses progressively increases, increasing the difficulty of discrimination, but they remain non-identical. These three-stage preference data, coupled with real user behavior sequences, progressively serve as training data Di for preference learning,
as shown in Eq (3). Alternatively, the prefix-ngram match
metric can be extended to SCID vector-similarity metric, for
a softer sample construction strategy.
Progressive RF-DPO captures authentic user feedback as
preference data for alignment by recommending its own
generated results to users. Feedback is categorized into three
levels: disliked, neutral, and liked. Aligned with progressive learning, training occurs in stages: an easy stage uses
strongly disliked items as negatives (liked as positives),
while a hard stage uses neutral items as harder negatives
(liked remains positive). This staged approach systematically strengthens preference learning. In industrial recommendation settings, levels are defined by user behavior: disliked (explicit negative, e.g., dislike), neutral (implicit negative, e.g., impression without click), liked (positive, e.g., like
or purchase). For public datasets (e.g., Amazon reviews),
we use an LLM-based sentiment model (ecomgpt (Li et al.
2023)) to score reviews, mapping scores to levels: disliked
(1), neutral (2-3), and liked (4-5). Integrating this finegrained feedback enables RF-DPO to better align with user
interests and business goals, improving recommendation relevance.
Our progressive DPO framework offers several key advantages. By adopting a progression from easy to hard stages
and leveraging both self-play and real-world feedback, the
model continually enhances its ability to discern and generalize user preferences, overcoming the “preference ceiling” of static data. The key theoretical insight is that welldesigned curricula can provide smoother interpolation between task distributions, leading to more efficient learning
compared to direct approaches.

Experiments
Experimental Settings
Datasets. We conduct experiments on three real-world sequential recommendation datasets from diverse domains: (1)

Instruments, a subset of the Amazon review corpus focusing on user interactions with musical equipment; (2) Beauty,
also from the Amazon review datasets, contains extensive
user behaviors related to beauty products; and (3) Yelp, comprising user-business interactions from the Yelp challenge
dataset. For fair comparison, we preprocess the data following standard protocols (Zheng et al. 2024; Rajput et al. 2023;
Wang et al. 2024a), filtering users and items with fewer than
five interactions and applying the leave-one-out strategy for
splitting into training, validation, and test sets. We restrict
each user’s history length to a maximum of 20 for all sequential models. Finally, we deploy Align3 GR online and
conduct A/B tests to further validate its performance on an
industrial advertising recommendation platform.
Baselines. We compare our method with strong baselines
from both conventional and generative recommender systems, covering various tokenization and alignment strategies: (1) MF (Mehta and Rana 2017) (Matrix Factorization); (2) Caser (Tang and Wang 2018); (3) HGN(Ma,
Kang, and Liu 2019); (4) BERT4Rec (Sun et al. 2019);
(5) LightGCN (He et al. 2020); (6) SASRec (Kang and
McAuley 2018); (7) BIGRec (Bao et al. 2025), an LLMbased GR using item titles as textual identifiers; (8) P5SemID (Wang et al. 2024a), leveraging item metadata for
semantic identifiers; (9) P5-CID (Wang et al. 2024a), incorporating collaborative signals via clustering for LLM-based
models; (10) TIGER (Rajput et al. 2023), which applies
codebook-based quantized identifiers; (11) LC-Rec (Zheng
et al. 2024), enhancing codebook tokenization with auxiliary alignment tasks; (12) LETTER (Wang et al. 2024a),
a learnable tokenizer for generative recommendation; (13)
EAGER-LLM (Hong et al. 2025), which further models
user-item collaborative signals for token-level alignment.
All baselines are implemented or adapted using open-source
code where available.
Evaluation Metrics. We evaluate model performance
using standard top-K metrics: Recall@K (R@K) and
NDCG@K (N@K) for K ∈ 5, 10, following previous
work (Rajput et al. 2023; Zheng et al. 2024; Hong et al.
2025). During training, we limit each user’s historical interaction sequence to the most recent 20 items. For generative methods utilizing beam search, we follow EAGERLLM and consistently set the beam width to 20.
Implementation Details. Our method is instantiated on
Llama2-7B (Touvron et al. 2023) as the backbone LLM,
with LoRA-based parameter-efficient fine-tuning (Hu et al.
2022). For item tokenization, we use a 3-level RQ-VAE,
each codebook containing 256 embeddings of dimension 32.
SCID representations for both users and items are incorporated into the model vocabulary to prevent OOV. Training is performed for 20,000 steps using the AdamW optimizer with a batch size of 1024. The learning rate is selected
from the set 1e−3, 5e−4, 1e−4 based on validation performance. All experiments are conducted on 4 NVIDIA RTX
A800 GPUs. Hyperparameters such as α and β are tuned
on the validation set. For each sample of Softmax-DPO, the
number chosen is set to 1, and the number rejected is set to
20. During evaluation, we report the average results over five
runs with different random seeds.

IDs as tokens for the sequence task, while “+” indicates cumulative addition of each module.

Offline Performance
Table 1 reports the overall offline performance of all methods on three benchmark datasets. From the results, we have
the following observations:
First, Align3 GR consistently achieves the best or competitive results across all datasets and evaluation metrics.
Compared to the strongest generative baselines such as LETTER and LC-Rec, our method yields substantial improvements with p < 0.05, especially on the Instructments dataset,
where it surpasses EAGER-LLM by 17.8% in Recall@10
and 20.2% in NDCG@10. This demonstrates the advantage
of our multi-level alignment strategy in effectively capturing
complex user preferences and collaborative relationships.
Second, We visualize the incremental improvements
under incremental alignment configurations. Figure 4 reveals a clear upward trajectory. Notably, replacing itemside semantic IDs with dual learning-based item-side SCIDs

yields a sharp performance boost in token-level alignment,
underscoring the value of modeling collaborative semantics at the token level. The preference-level alignment stage
yields the most substantial improvement, underscoring the
effectiveness of progressive DPO with self-play and realworld feedback. Throughout all stages, our method significantly outperforms the SOTA baseline (EAGER-LLM), confirming the superiority of multi-level alignment in bridging
the gap between LLMs and RS.
Finally, these results underscore the effectiveness of
Align3 GR. By jointly optimizing user and item representations at the token, behavior, and preference levels, Align3 GR
is able to capture collaborative signals and dynamic user
intents comprehensively. The significant performance gains
across offline evaluations confirm that each level of alignment, together with our unified tokenization and adaptive
preference optimization strategies, is essential for achieving
robust, scalable generative recommendation.

Online A/B Test
We further validate the practical efficacy of Align3 GR using an internal industrial dataset and online A/B test. On
a large-scale industrial advertising recommendation platform, we allocated 10% of the traffic (approximately 40+
million users) over multiple weeks for A/B testing. As Table 2 demonstrates, Align3 GR surpasses both an industrial two-tower retrieval baseline and the generative TIGER
model in online retrieval performance (recall@100) while
significantly improving critical business metrics. Specifically, Align3 GR achieves a statistically significant +1.432%

revenue improvement in all advertising scenarios under fullscale deployment. These results confirm that Align3 GR’s
multi-level alignment translates offline advantages into measurable business value in production environments at scale.

Ablation Study
To thoroughly investigate the effect of each alignment level,
we conduct comprehensive ablation studies on the Instruments dataset. To ensure fairness, when ablations are performed on one alignment level, the configurations of the remaining levels are fixed to their best settings. For example,
when studying token-level alignment, we adopt the full setting of SFT tasks and the progressive RF-DPO strategy.
Effect of Dual SCID Tokenization. Table 3 presents
the ablation results on the Instruments dataset to evaluate
the effectiveness of Dual SCID Tokenization. First, simply
switching from single-sided (item-only) to dual-sided tokenization yields a significant performance boost, demonstrating the necessity of jointly modeling both user and item
token representations. Second, incorporating CF on top of
semantic inputs further enhances performance under both
single and dual settings, highlighting the importance of integrating collaborative signals during representation learning. Third, enabling U-I alignment via the U2I behavior loss
leads to consistent gains, especially when combined with
dual tokenization and CF. This confirms the efficacy of our
joint optimization strategy in bridging the gap between user
and item SC embeddings. Overall, these results justify the
choices for SCID construction and demonstrate that all three
components are complementary and critical for optimal recommendation performance.

without user-item joint encoding, while “Dual” activates
both user and item tokenization. The “CF” column indicates
whether collaborative features are included, and “U-I Alignment” specifies if user and item embeddings are jointly optimized by U2I behavior loss.
Effect of Behavior Modeling-level Alignment Tasks.
Table 4 presents the ablation results for multi-task SFT on
the Instruments dataset. We begin with the SEQ task as the
backbone, using the item SCIDs from users’ historical behaviors as the sequence. Introducing user SCID yields additional gains, indicating that structured and informative token
representations help the LLM better capture user-item interaction semantics. Furthermore, the inclusion of user-side
alignment (B2 ), which introduces bidirectional supervision

between user profiles and SCID, brings the most significant
performance boost across all metrics, highlighting the critical role of exposing LLMs to structured user semantics.
These findings support our hypothesis that effective alignment requires supervision at both the token level and the
semantic level, enabling the model to build stronger correspondence between language and recommendation signals.
Effect of Preference-Level Alignment Tasks. To assess the impact of our proposed preference-level alignment
strategies, we perform an ablation study on SP-DPO and RFDPO using the Instruments dataset, as shown in Table 5.
Starting from a well-trained SFT model, we first examine
the DPO baseline and then progressively incorporate SelfPlay and Progressive strategies within each framework. In
the SP-DPO branch, adding Self-Play improves Recall@10
from 0.1295 to 0.1356, and further gains are observed when
applying progressive learning. In the RF-DPO branch, progressive training consistently outperforms the static variant,
culminating in the best overall performance. These results
demonstrate the complementary benefits of progressive optimization and real feedback integration in aligning LLMs
with user preference signals.

Conclusion
We propose a unified multi-level alignment framework
Align3 GR that bridges the gap between LLMs and personalized recommendations through dual SCID tokenization,
multi-task behavior modeling, and progressive preference
optimization. Experiments on real-world datasets show our
method outperforms strong baselines. Results highlight the
importance of hierarchical alignment for LLM-based GRs,
enabling more robust and adaptive personalization.
